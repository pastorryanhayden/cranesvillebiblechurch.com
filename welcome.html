        <h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>We are a church that is committed to equipping believers to grow in their faith and understanding of the Word of God through teaching, preaching, singing, and serving.</p>

<p>We offer many opportunities for families and individuals of all ages to gather and grow in their faith. These include Sunday School classes for all age groups, youth group, children’s clubs, men’s and women’s ministries, and senior’s fellowship activities.</p>
We strive to faithfully teach the Bible in a way that engages, instructs, and challenges every believer. Our focus is not only to learn what the Bible says, but also how it applies to our lives today. As such, we recognize that the Bible is God’s revelation of Himself to us, and thus we are to focus on It rather than on our own opinions.</p>
